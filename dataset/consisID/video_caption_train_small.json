The interface shows the Photoshop workspace with various panels and tools visible.\n\n1. **Workspace Layout**: The screen displays the Photoshop interface with several panels open. The left side has the Tools panel, which includes various editing tools like the Brush, Eraser, and Selection tools. The right side has the Properties panel, which shows options for the selected tool and layer properties.\n\n2. **Image Display**: In the center of the screen is the image being edited. The image shows a person standing against a plain background. The person is wearing a brown leather jacket, black pants, and boots. The background is a solid light color, possibly white or light gray.\n\n3. **Selection Tool**: The person's image is selected using the Lasso tool, which is highlighted in the Tools panel. This indicates that the user is in the process of selecting the area around the person to remove the background.\n\n4. **Layer Panel**: Below the image, there is a Layer panel showing layers 1 and 2. Layer 1 is the active layer, and it appears to be the image layer itself. Layer 2 is labeled \"Remove Background,\" suggesting that this layer is used for the background removal process.\n\n5. **Transform Tool**: The Transform tool is active, as indicated by the bounding box around the person's image. This tool allows the user to resize, rotate, or distort the selected area.\n\n6. **Quick Actions Panel**: At the bottom of the screen, there is a Quick Actions panel with options like \"Remove Background\" and \"Select All.\" These options are likely shortcuts for common tasks during the editing process.\n\n7. **Background Removal Process**: The user is likely in the process of using the Lasso tool to carefully select the person's outline, then applying the Remove Background feature to isolate the subject from the background. The Transform tool might be used to fine-tune the selection or adjust the position of the subject.\n\nOverall, the video seems to be a step-by-step guide on how to use Photoshop to remove backgrounds from images, demonstrating the use of various tools and features within the software.",
